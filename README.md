- 👋 Hi Folks! I’m @LaserHermit, aka TheHermit (already taken on github)
- 👀 1978-1988, I was a laserist who performed shows and developed projection systems. 
- 🌱 Now retired and reincarnated, I'm making a Laser Synthesizer with a Teensy 4.1, audio shields, and op amp circuits
- 💞️ Although I've achieved proof of concept, I'm no C++ developer, by any stretch of the imagine.
-    So, I'm posting what I have in hopes of someone smarter than myself replacing my garbage sketch with proper code.
-   -     
- 📫 How to reach me ...
